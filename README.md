# Online Bookstore Application Overview

The Online Bookstore Application is a web-based platform that allows users to read and download books. It provides a user-friendly interface for browsing a collection of books, reading book previews, and purchasing or downloading books for offline reading. The application consists of two main components:

## Frontend:
Developed using React.js, the frontend provides an interactive user interface for browsing books, viewing book details, and managing user interactions.

## Backend:
Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, the backend handles user authentication, manages book data, and facilitates communication between the frontend and the database. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for efficient and secure user authentication.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Utilizes JWT for secure authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Browse Books:** Displays a collection of books with search and filter functionality.
- **View Book Details:** Provides detailed information about each book, including title, author, genre, description, and cover image.
- **Read Book Previews:** Allows users to read previews of books before purchasing or downloading them.
